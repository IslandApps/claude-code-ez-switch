## 📋 Prerequisites

Before installing Claude Code EZ Switch, ensure you have the following:

- **Python**: Version 3.7 or higher
- **Operating System**: Windows 10 or above
- **Claude Code CLI**: The command-line interface version of Claude Code

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone or download this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/techcow2/claude-code-ez-switch.git
   cd claude-code-ez-switch
   ```

2. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python ezswitch.py
   ```

No additional packages need to be installed - all dependencies are included with standard Python installations!

## 🎯 How to Use

### 1. Launch the Application
Simply run `ezswitch.py` to open the configuration manager.

### 2. Choose Your Configuration

#### **Z.ai Configuration**
- Select "Z.ai" radio button
- Enter your Z.ai API key
- Click "Apply Configuration"

#### **Anthropic Claude Configuration**
- Select "Anthropic" radio button
- Choose between:
  - **Subscription Mode**: Use your Claude Pro/Team/Enterprise subscription
  - **API Key Mode**: Enter your Claude API key
- Click "Apply Configuration"

#### **Moonshot.ai Configuration**
- Select "Moonshot.ai" radio button
- Enter your Moonshot.ai API key
- Click "Apply Configuration"
- **📝 Note**: Moonshot.ai uses the Kimi model family (kimi-v1, kimi-v1.5, kimi-v1.5-long) which are compatible with Claude Code
- Ensure your Moonshot.ai account has API access enabled
- Verify your API key has sufficient credits for usage

#### **Custom Configuration**
- Select "Custom" radio button
- Enter your custom base URL (e.g., `https://your-api-endpoint.com`)
- Enter your custom API key
- Click "Apply Configuration"

### 3. Apply Changes
After clicking "Apply Configuration":
- The application will set the necessary environment variables
- **🔴 CRITICAL**: You must close **ALL** applications running Claude Code, including:
  - VS Code (if running Claude Code in the VS Code terminal)
  - VS Code with Claude Code extension
  - Claude Code CLI in PowerShell terminals
  - Claude Code CLI in Command Prompt terminals
  - Any other applications using Claude Code
- Then reopen these applications for changes to take effect
- **Important**: The API configuration loaded in this app will reflect for both the CLI version and VS Code extension of Claude Code
- Environment variables are only read when applications first start

### 4. Special Login Requirements
**When switching to Anthropic configuration from another configuration:**
- After reopening Claude Code CLI, you must log back into your Anthropic account
- Run the command: `/login`
- This is required because switching from other endpoints clears your authentication session

### 5. Verify Configuration
Use the "Refresh" button to check your current configuration status at any time.

## 🔧 Configuration Details

The application manages the following Windows user environment variables that are used by **both Claude Code CLI and Claude Code VS Code extension**:

- `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`: Your API authentication token
- `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`: The API base URL (if applicable)

**Note**: The API configuration set by this application will be used by both the CLI version and the VS Code extension of Claude Code, as they both read from the same environment variables.

### Configuration Examples:

**Z.ai**:
- `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`: Your Z.ai API key
- `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`: `https://api.z.ai/api/anthropic`

**Moonshot.ai**:
- `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`: Your Moonshot.ai API key
- `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`: `https://api.moonshot.ai/anthropic`
- **🔍 Endpoint Verification**: Test your Moonshot.ai endpoint with:
  ```bash
  curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" https://api.moonshot.ai/anthropic/v1/models
  ```
- **⚡ Rate Limits**: Moonshot.ai has different rate limits for free vs paid accounts
- **🌐 Alternative Endpoints**: If the main endpoint is unavailable, try:
  - Primary: `https://api.moonshot.ai/anthropic`
  - Alternative: `https://api.moonshot.cn/anthropic`

**Claude API**:
- `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`: Your Claude API key
- `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`: Not set (uses default)

**Custom**:
- `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`: Your custom API key
- `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`: Your custom endpoint URL

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"This application is designed for Windows only"**
   - This app only works on Windows due to PowerShell environment variable management

2. **Configuration not taking effect**
   - **CRITICAL**: Make sure you have closed ALL applications using Claude Code (VS Code with Claude Code extension, Claude Code CLI in PowerShell, Claude Code CLI in Command Prompt, etc.) before reopening them
   - Environment variables are only loaded when applications start, not dynamically
   - Check that your application reads user-level environment variables
   - Remember that both Claude Code CLI and VS Code extension use the same environment variables set by this application

3. **Authentication issues when switching to Anthropic**
   - After switching to Anthropic configuration, you must run `claude code /login` in the CLI
   - This is required because switching from other endpoints clears your authentication session
   - Make sure you're logged into the correct Anthropic account

4. **API keys not saving**
   - Ensure the application has write permissions to your user home directory
   - Check for the config directory at `%USERPROFILE%\.claude_ez_switch\`
   - The config file should be located at `%USERPROFILE%\.claude_ez_switch\config.json`

5. **PowerShell command failures**
   - Run the application as Administrator if you encounter permission issues
   - Ensure PowerShell execution policy allows running scripts

6. **Moonshot.ai specific issues**
   - **"Invalid API key" error**: Verify your Moonshot.ai API key is correct and has proper permissions
   - **"Endpoint not found" error**: Check if Moonshot.ai has changed their API endpoint URL
   - **Slow response times**: Moonshot.ai may have higher latency compared to other providers
   - **Model not available**: Ensure you're using a supported model (kimi-v1, kimi-v1.5, kimi-v1.5-long)
   - **Rate limiting**: Check your account limits at https://platform.moonshot.ai/account/limits
   - **Regional restrictions**: Some Moonshot.ai features may be restricted based on your geographic location

## 📝 Development

### Project Structure:
=======
>>>>>>> d8b921b4a1b4aa510c04d8f921c3649a6e388ac2
```
git clone https://github.com/techcow2/claude-code-ez-switch.git
cd claude-code-ez-switch
python ezswitch.py
```

## Quick Start

1. Run `python ezswitch.py`  
2. Select your configuration (Z.ai, Anthropic, or Custom) and enter your API key/URL  
3. Click **Apply Configuration**  
4. Close and reopen all Claude Code applications (VS Code, terminals, etc.) for changes to take effect  
5. If switching to Anthropic, run `/login` in the CLI to re-authenticate  

## How It Works

The app sets these Windows environment variables:  

- `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`: Your API key  
- `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`: Your API endpoint (if custom)  

Both Claude Code CLI and the VS Code extension read these variables on startup.  

## Troubleshooting

- **Changes not working?** Close all Claude Code apps and reopen them. Variables only load on startup.  
- **Permission denied?** Run the app as Administrator.  
- **Anthropic login failed?** Run `/login` in the CLI after switching to Anthropic.
